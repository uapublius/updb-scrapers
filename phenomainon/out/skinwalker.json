Probably simply stars, but unknown","Security Guard observes a red orb maneuvering through the trees. Stolle moved toward the ranch vehicle to initiate a western patrol.  Stolle noticed one of the ranch dogs huddled at the back of the vehicle.  As Stolle attempted to get the dog to move, the dog crawled underneath the vehicle.  The caretaker Dietz had to assist in getting the dog out from under the vehicle by coaxing it with a dog biscuit.  This was abnormal behavior for the animal.  As Stolle was driving west along the dirt road at approximately 9:17 p.m. he suddenly got goose bumps on his arms and the hairs on his arms stood straight up.  He looked to his left (south) and observed a softball-sized round orb in the field about 25 to 30 yards away.  The orb traveled through the field and disappeared around the first incline heading west.  Stolle stopped the vehicle, then turned the vehicle around and returned to Homestead 1.  Stolle reported what he had observed to Dietz and entered the trailer and reported the incident to the Security Chief via telephone.  Dietz, standing in the backyard of Homestead 1, then observed a white orb come down from the sky and hit the ground in the pasture.  Dietz reported this to Stolle.  While Stolle and Dietz were watching for additional events, they observed several abnormal \u201cblinking stars.\u201d  While looking through binoculars they observed these were not stars \u2013 they were some sort of object that remained in place with red, green, and white lights spinning around the lower half of the object.

The object was moving at a high rate of speed and reversed course (without turning) and traveled down its original path in the opposite direction.. Possibly an aircraft","2 red lights and 4 white lights forming a square shape, stop and start motion. At approximately 10:00 p.m. Kavanaugh observed some abnormal lights in the distant southwest sky about 12 fingers above the tree line.  Using binoculars he observed four white lights forming a square with one red light in the center and a second red light just to the right of center.  Collectively, the lights would remain stationary, then move as a whole, and become stationary again.  This happened several times.  The lights were last observed making a rapid upward turn to the southeast.  Immediately following the observation, Kavanaugh\u2019s eyes began to hurt and he felt a slight pain across his eyebrow from temple to temple which lasted five minutes.. ","Soft milky-white, round lights, from tennis-softball size, came from the plateau. While Kavanaugh and Dietz were on the back porch of the trailer at Homestead 1 throughout the evening, they observed numerous soft, milky-white round lights that ranged in size from a tennis ball to a softball.  The objects appeared sporadically and usually originated to the northwest by the mesa.  At one time there were approximately six of these round lights visible together.  The closest light came within approximately 30 feet of the porch.. ","Security Guard observes single soft, milky-white light ten feet away and one foot off ground. While standing on the back porch of the trailer at Homestead 1 at 7:50 p.m., Kavanaugh observed a single soft, milky-white round light about ten feet due west.

The objects appeared sporadically and usually originated from the treel line near Homestead 2 or to the northwest by the mesa.  At one time they observed three light blue lights just east of Dogrun 1 about one foot above the ground.  The three lights were about five feet apart and lined up from north to south.  Later they observed a set of three green softball-sized lights one foot above the ground.  All of the lights were only observed for approximately one second each.. ","1 white light with blue tint, initially stationary then disappeared. While driving west along the road as he approached Homestead 2 at approximately 8:10 p.m., Garrett observed a single dim white light with tint of blue glowing from it.  The light was softball sized and about four feet above the ground near the corral area north of the road \u2013 about 15 yards from Garrett.  He watched the object sit stationary for 15 \u2013 20 seconds, then the light suddenly disappeared as if it extinguished.  While Garrett watched the object he was excited \u2013 the hair stood up on the back of his neck and he had goose bumps on his arms..

At approximately 11:15 p.m. Garrett placed his wallet, watch, and wedding ring on the nightstand beside the bed in the bedroom with the queen bed.  Garrett then departed the trailer to begin a patrol.  He returned to the trailer at 1:45 a.m. and noticed that his wedding ring was not on the nightstand with the other items.  Garrett had an uneasy feeling as if he were not alone.  He searched the bedroom for the ring.  When he moved a pair of jeans (washed and placed in position two days prior) that were positioned on top of the dresser inside the closet, the ring fell out of the jeans pocket.  This freaked him out and made the hair on his entire body stand up.  He thought someone or something was next to him.  The uneasy feeling cleared after a few minutes..

While Kavanaugh and Dietz were on the back porch of the trailer at Homestead 1 between 6:00 to 9:00 p.m., they observed numerous soft, milky-white round lights that were softball sized.  The lights were sporadic and appeared from southwest through northwest of the back porch.  The closest light appeared approximately 35 feet away in the direction of Dogrun 1.

","stationary light slightly above highest peak. . \"We ruled out any celestial body, as any object would have been completely hidden by the cloud cover.\" Additionally computer based software containing star maps confirmed that no celestial body should have been visible in that area of the sky.\" \"Given that the light could only be seen using the NVGs it is possible that it was an infrared reflector or another but much larger night vision device. It is possible that someone was using a tripod mounted night vision device from the top of the mesa. The location of the light would be an outstanding high point for reconnaissance of a majority of the property.  In order to test this theory, Advisor 4 went down range using his night vision scope. From the deck of homestead 1, we did see the light from his scope at approximately 500 meters out; however, the light source was smaller and moving. We demonstrated that no matter how hard one may try to hold the device still there is still detectable movement supporting the need for a tripod. Additionally Advisor 4 held an IR reflector known as \u2018glint tape\u2019, which could not be seen at 500 meters from our NVGs. This was expected, as the third generation NVGs used do not have an IR Illuminator. These tests demonstrate the previous conclusion that the source may have been a larger night vision device; however, based on the size of the light it would have to be a very large, tripod mounted, source which would be very difficult to get up to the top of the mesa and most likely too expensive for a local amateur observer.\" \"During the daylight hours on 1 July, Advisors climbed up to the point where we saw the light. We confirmed that it is an excellent reconnaissance point. Additionally we found fresh cigarettes (two different brands indicating likely multiple persons), and empty energy drink cans indicating the effort to stay awake and alert at night.  Advisor 5 located boot prints leading down to horse tracks on the back side of the mesa leading us to believe that unknown persons are riding horses as far as they can then walking up to the reconnaissance point.  Based on the terrain it is our opinion that it would be very difficult to get large and heavy equipment up to the observation point. The trespassers likely travel light and use handheld equipment. \"","Awakened by the sound of somebody coming in the front door, footsteps down the hall and saw a shadow figure in the bedroom doorway.

Jonah Listed Some Animals That He Has Seen On The Betts Ranch \u2013 Black Bear, Elk, Deer, Pheasant, And Coyote.\r\n","Yes: Coyote/Wild-Dog Type Creature Was Shot With A Rifle. At First Glance They Initially Thought The Object Was A Coyote Or Wild Dog. They Both Decided To Try And Shoot It Because They Fear Coyotes And/Or Wild Dogs Will Attack Their Live Stock Of Chicken, Sheep, Cows, Llamas, Horses And Goats. They Took Aim And Fired One Time Each, Hitting The Animal One Time.  Blaine Said He Knew The Animal Was Hit Because They Could See The Impact Shock On Its Side.  Instead Of Falling Over, Animal Stood Up Intentionally And Graciously. The Creature Turned Its Head And Looked At Blaine And Jonah. Creature Looked Like An Irish Wolfhound. It Had Long \"Fox Red\", Coarse Hair. It Had Dog-Like Paws And Small Pointy Ears. The Creature'S Legs Were Angled, Curved, And Overall Shaped Like A Dog.

As The Animal Ran Away It Approached A Small Cliff Which Dropped Down About 12 Feet. At The Bottom Of The Cliff Was The Creek. The Animal Didn\u2019T Slow Down Or Hesitate Jumping Off. Blaine Said His Dog Did Not Follow The Animal Down The Cliff. Blaine And Jonah Ran Towards The Cliff To See Where The Animal Landed Because They Figured It Was Dying From The Gunshot. As They Approached The Edge Of The Cliff They Saw The Animal Had Crossed The Creek And Was Now On A Small Plateau. The Animal Stopped And Appeared To Be Resting On All Fours. Blaine And Jonah Both Fired Their Rifles Again. Blaine Said They Know The Animal Was Hit One Time Because He Could See The Impact And It Fell Over. The Animal Immediately Got Back Up And Stood On Its Hind Legs. The Animal Began Running On Its Hind Legs Towards A Bunch Of Trees About 100 Yards From Where It Was Standing. The Animal Appeared To Use The Trees And A Type Of Concealment. After A Very Brief Stay The Animal Started Running In A Northwest Direction Towards A Grove Of Russian Olive Trees. The Animal Entered The Grove And Disappeared And Was Not Seen Again.","Using His Night Vision Scope He Stated That He Thought He Saw A Shadowy Figure Near The Homestead But There Was No Other Sign Of Activity.

As They Climbed The Embankment And Got To The Top, Jonah Stated Both He And His Cousin Observed The Dog Like Creature Running On Two Legs, In A North-East Direction Away From Them. Jonah Stated The Creature Appeared Darker In Color; However He Stated It Was Quite A Ways Away; However Jonah Could Clearly Identify Pointy Ears. Jonah Stated The Sighting Occurred Around Noon Time.

Blaine Became Worried Because He Said It Was The Exact Same Odor They Smelled When They Witnessed The Dog-Like Creature Run Away On Its Hind Legs. It Was About 2130 Hours When The Smell Saturated The House. Blaine Stated The Odor Smelled Rotten And Also Like Sulfur. I Asked Jonah If The Smell Could Have Been From A Nearby Dead Animal.  Blaine And Jonah Both Replied At The Same Time That The Smell Was Not Of A Dead Animal Because They Have A Dead Cow And Dog In Their Rear Yard. Jonah Said It Was Too Cold For An Animal To Rot And That It Hasn\u2019T Been Above Freezing In Several Weeks. \r\nBlaine Stated When He And Jonah Associated The Smell With Their Previous Sighting Of The Creature They Both Ran Out The Front Door To See If They Could See It Again. When They Opened The Door They Both Immediately Heard Something Running Away In A Northeast Direction Away From Them. Jonah Stated They Both Started Walking Towards The Horse Corral When They Heard Something Running Through The Brush And Trees.  Blaine Pointed Out The Direction This Thing Was Running In Was The Same Direction They Previously Saw The Upright Two-Legged Dog Run, Which Was Towards Gulch Creek. Blaine Said He And Jonah Could Not See What Was Creating The Noise And Smell And Realized It Was Dark Outside, And Became Scared. Jonah Said After Their Initial Sighting Of The Dog-Like Creature They Are Afraid To Be On The Rear Part Of Their Property At Night Time. Blaine Said He Ran Back To The House So Fast That He Actually Made It There Before 15-Year-Old Jonah.  Once Back Inside The House He Did Not Notice The Smell Anymore And Assumed It Had Disappeared Along With The Animal.  \r\nJonah Continued To Tell Us That They Never Saw Or Identified The Object Which Was Running Through The Trees Nor Did They Ever Discover The Source Of The Foul Odor. \r\n\r\nEncounter The Friday Before The Investigative Team Arrived \u2013 On This Night While Inside Their House, The Family Detected The Signature Stench Of The Creature.
