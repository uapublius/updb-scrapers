From the transcript of the taped interview with Investigator Pete Pickup:\n\n\"When we were coming from working at the temple, and I believe it was 2 years ago, I believe it was in the fall, it was evening, we had done stopping at dinner [?] so I was in, around 7:30, kinda when the sun’s going down but it’s not dark, you know?  And just above the hill, we could just see this big round thing sitting above the hill, kinda like a basketball, kinda yellow-orange color, wasn’t moving, just sitting there.  So, it wasn’t the sun or the moon, wasn’t the right size for those things, so we thought ‘well gee, that’s odd.’  So we were kinda watching it and after watching it for a few minutes, all of a sudden it just went straight down to the ground.  And it was gone.\"\n\nObject may have moved downward out of sight behind the bluff at the Utah Ranch.\n\nFollowing this interview, Colleen agreed to make a sketch of the object; however, she requested a few days to go to the location on Highway 40 where the object was noted, before doing so.

    "Incident": "stationary light slightly above highest peak. . \"We ruled out any celestial body, as any object would have been completely hidden by the cloud cover.\" Additionally computer based software containing star maps confirmed that no celestial body should have been visible in that area of the sky.\" \"Given that the light could only be seen using the NVGs it is possible that it was an infrared reflector or another but much larger night vision device. It is possible that someone was using a tripod mounted night vision device from the top of the mesa. The location of the light would be an outstanding high point for reconnaissance of a majority of the property.  In order to test this theory, Advisor 4 went down range using his night vision scope. From the deck of homestead 1, we did see the light from his scope at approximately 500 meters out; however, the light source was smaller and moving. We demonstrated that no matter how hard one may try to hold the device still there is still detectable movement supporting the need for a tripod. Additionally Advisor 4 held an IR reflector known as ‘glint tape’, which could not be seen at 500 meters from our NVGs. This was expected, as the third generation NVGs used do not have an IR Illuminator. These tests demonstrate the previous conclusion that the source may have been a larger night vision device; however, based on the size of the light it would have to be a very large, tripod mounted, source which would be very difficult to get up to the top of the mesa and most likely too expensive for a local amateur observer.\" \"During the daylight hours on 1 July, Advisors climbed up to the point where we saw the light. We confirmed that it is an excellent reconnaissance point. Additionally we found fresh cigarettes (two different brands indicating likely multiple persons), and empty energy drink cans indicating the effort to stay awake and alert at night.  Advisor 5 located boot prints leading down to horse tracks on the back side of the mesa leading us to believe that unknown persons are riding horses as far as they can then walking up to the reconnaissance point.  Based on the terrain it is our opinion that it would be very difficult to get large and heavy equipment up to the observation point. The trespassers likely travel light and use handheld equipment. \"",
