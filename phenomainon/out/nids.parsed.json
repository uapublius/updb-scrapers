When He Realized The Case Was Culminating Right In Front Of His House, Took His Video Camera Out To The Tape The Arrest. When He Came Back Inside And Looked Out The Window To See If The Wrecker Truck Had Arrived, He Saw 5 Craft (Some People Thought There Were Only 4) Flying Low Over His House, About 1000 Feet In The Air. They Each Had An Extremely Bright Blue Strobe Light (1 Of The Crafts Had 2), And They Were Totally Silent, Flying About 70-75 Mph. There Is A Valley Across The Road From His House, And He Watched (And Taped) As The Craft Stopped And Hovered There Quite Awhile. While Hovering, 2 Of The Craft Flew Down Below The Tree Line (Trying To Land?), While 1 Slight Larger Craft Hovered At About 1000 Feet. Then The Hovering Craft Rolled Up On Its Side, \"Like A Wing Rollover\". Dogs Were Barking, And The Wind Was Blowing, But There Was No Other Sound. The Crafts Then Lined Up Again In The V-Formation, Then Did More Maneuvers, Up And Down And Around, Then Slowly Flew Off To The West. The Craft Repeated Their Maneuvering Of Hovering, A Couple Of Them Dropping Down While The Other One Hovered And Rolled Up, Then Resume The V Formation And Fly A Little Farther West.

Well, As I Was Taking The Photos And Video I Started Talking To It Was Not Ususual. As I Did I Would Point To The Video Camera And Say I Had To Move It. Well, On The Last Two Photos I Had Taken I Pointed To The Video Camera And Said I Had To Move It And Then I Put My Hands On The View Thing That Looks Like A Little Tv On The Side Of The Video Camera. I Backed Up To The Edge Of Our Home In Order To Photograph The Video Camera And The Glowing Ufo Together. I Went In The House To View What I Had But Did Not Pay To Much Attention To It Because It Is A Normal Thing. But On 10/25/04 I Went Threw The Photos With A Fine Tooth Comb. The Last Two Photos Show That I Had Made Contact With The Glowing Ufo. The Photos Show The Glowing Ufo'S Scanning Beam Coming Down And Stopping Right At The Camera And Sending Back The Image, Looking Like A Bunch Of Squares. I'M Really Lost Without Words.",

My Craft Too Had Six Lights On Each Side, But Did Not Line Up Perfectly With The Ones On The Other Side. Perhaps There Was A Light Missing On One Side.

I Glanced At The Road For A Second ( I Was Doing 70 Mph) And When I Looked Backed To My Left Again I Could See The Object Had Tilted On End And That The Light Of The Moon Was Reflecting Off Its Body. I Could See That It Was Black Or Grey And Triangular With Lights On Its Sides. I Looked Back At The The Road For A Second Or Two For Obvious Reasons, And When I Looked Backed At The Airport I Could See The Object Had Moved Off Way In The Distance And Up A Mile Or So (It Had To Have Been Going Very Fast To Reach That Altitude Between The Time That I Looked Down At The Road And Then Looked Back Up.

It Was Large Enough To Clearly See A Shape, And It Appeared Mostly Circular Or Disk Shaped. The Second, Smaller One Appeared To Be Circular Or Possible Spheroid; And Acted Much Like The First Until I Shot At *And Hit It* It With A Low-Powered Handheld Laser With A 532Nm Wavelength And A Measured Output Power Of 7.6 Milliwatts Typical, 11.62 Milliwatts Maximum. I Could Briefly See The Green Spot On The Underside Of The Object Several Times As The Handheld Laser Was Aimed Towards It. The Beam Itself Could Be Seen As A Line In The Sky, So Targeting Wasn'T An Issue; Locking Onto A Moving Target Was. So The Spot Would Appear As A Brief Green Flash On The Underside Of The Object As It Passed Overhead And As My Laser Beam Scanned Across It. After I Hit It Several Times, It Slowed Down, Made An Abrupt Turn To The N Or Slightly Nnw, Kept Moving Slowly For A Few More Seconds, And Then Stopped Dead In The Air. By This Time I Rid Myself Of The Laser Because I Honestly Thought The Object Was Going To Start Shooting Back. It Then Just Hung Stationary For 15-20 Seconds, And Then Suddenly Vanished, Like Somebody Turning Off A Lamp. Note That I Would Never Shoot A Laser Or Other Light Source At Aircraft Showing Nav Lights Of Any Type, With Any Type Of Engine Sounds, Or Showing Wings Or Other Body Parts Consistent With Known Aircraft Design. I Shot At These Objects Thinking They Were Possibly Balloons Or Plastic Bags Caught Up In The Breeze. Only Afterwards I Realised The Dominant Wind Direction (Light, From The N To Nne) Was Inconsistent With The Flight Path Taken By These Objects.\n\nI Also Looked *Very Thoroughly* For Any Moving Parts To Try And Rule Out A Sea Bird As The Offending Object, And Did Not See Any Movement Or Lighting Change Of Any Type Consistent With The Flapping Of Bird Wings; Nor Did I Notice Any Lateral Elongation, Nonlinear Flight, Or Wobbling That Might Indicate A Bird Gliding On Air Currents.\n\nThe Flight Path & Behavior, Especially Of The Second Object, Was Not Consistent With The Wind Speed & Direction At The Time Of Sighting (As Determined By Puffs Of Smoke Or Fog That Would Occasionally Drift By Overhead).

It Descended Lower Towards The Ground And Seemd To Be Settling In A Nearby Field When Itls Color Had Shifted From A White To An Orange. As The Object Got Lower To The Ground, It Became Bigger, And Its Color Changed To A Reddish Light. The Object'S Size Increased From A Pea At Arm'S Length To A Dime. When It Became Red, Everything Went Crazy. The Animals In The Area Erupted In A Frenzy. After The Object Got Red, It Shot Of Like A Dart And Went West. After That The Two Sons Went Outside And Heard Screaming. It Was A Female Voice. Approximately 20 Minutes After The Sighting, The Police Were There. They Were About 20 Officers And A Rescue Squad Over In The Field. They Were Combing The Area And Asked Me What I Knew About Someone Screaming. Apparently, Other Had Heard The Screaming Sounds. According To One Of The Sons, The Voice Kept Saying, \"Help Me, Oh My God, Help Me!\"",

This Object Was Basically Triangluar In Shape Though Its Corners Were Missing And It Had Varous Colored Lights -- I Distinctly Remember Red, White And Green Along Its Edges.

The Way It Moved, Turned At The Lake, And Followed The Interstate (Somewhat), I Took It As A Military Project. I Told A Few People About It And Never Thought Another Thing About It.

It Was Early Evening, Dusk But Not Yet Dark, And Low In The South-Southwestern Sky I Saw What Seemed To Be A Triangular Object, Moving Slowly And Silently Toward The South. It Had Evenly-Spaced White Lights On Its Double-Delta Leading Edge. Based On It Apparent Size ( About That Of The Full Moon, Or A Half-Degree Of Arc), And The Impression Of Considerable Distance And Altitude Given By Its Slow Apparent Movement And Silence, I Calculated Afterward That It Could Have Been A Couple Hundred Feet Across, And On The Order Of Five Miles Away From Me. That Would Have Placed It Over Brooklyn, New York. For What It May Be Worth, I Also Remember Seeing A Newspaper Story Later That Week, Reporting That Motorist On A Highway In Brooklyn Had Reported Seeing A V-Shaped Formation Of Lights Passing Overhead.

It Is Far Too Many Years Ago For Me To Be More Specific Than I Have Been As I Was A Child Of About 8 Years Of Age When The Sighting Took Place. I Was Awakened By A Light Coming From Under My Curtains ( They Did Not Quite Reach The Bottom Of The Window). I Looked Out Of The Window And Saw A Triangular Object Above And Behind Some Trees That Were Opposite My House. It Had Bands Of Light Shimmering Across It Of Various Colours And Was Stationary And Silent. Occassionally Smaller Objects That Looked Like Flares Of Green And White Would Seem To Break Off Or Perhaps Come From Behind The Object. I Opened The Window To Make Sure That It Wasn'T A Reflection And Even Remember Pinching Myself To Make Sure I Was Not Dreaming. I Watched The Object For A While And Got Scared And Ran To Get My Parents In The Next Room. I Could Not Get Them Out Of Their Bed To Go The Window (They Thought I Was Having A Bad Dream) And I Stayed In Their Bed For The Rest Of The Night So I Do Not Know How Long The Object Remained Visible For. As I Fell Asleep, I Could Still Sense A Green Glow From Behind Their Curtains. I Often Wondered If I Was Crazy, But I Know I Was Not Dreaming, Especially As At The Time I Had, Of Course, Heard Of Flying Saucers, Aliens Etc (Run Up To The Apollo Landings Etc) But I Had Never Heard Of Triangular Ufo And Indeed Did Not Think Any One Had Ever Seen One Until I Read Communion In The 1980S (Although I Believe That Story Was Subsequently Discovered To Be A Hoax). I Have Never Reported This Sighting Before Although I Have Mentioned To Friends And Family Alike. What Has Made Me Share My Sighting With You Is A Story That Appeared On Space.Com Today About Increasing Sightings Of Triangular Objects Over Populated Areas And Could This Be The Dod Testing Some New Secret Aircraft. If That Is The Case, Then I Wonder How I Could Have Seen A Triangular Object Over Central London In The 1960S?",

Due To The Intensity Of The Lights, He Assumed It Was An Airplane Landing At Indianapolis Airport. Yet, As The Lights Approached The Interstate, He Began To Notice That They Didn'T Look Like An Airplane. The Craft Was Very Large And Wasn'T Lit Like A Plane. As It Came Closer And He Got A Look At The Underside, He Noticed Several Reddish Lights And What Seemed To Be Mechanical Fittings Or Structure That Was Strange-Looking. He Also Noticed That The Object Was Almost A Perfect Triangle In Shape. His Mother And Brother Also Saw It. He Continued To Watch It As It Went Over The Top Of Them. The Whole Time It Was In View, It Flew In A Straight Line At A Slow Speed. As It Was Spring Or Summer, They Had Car Windows Down And The Object Made No Sound Whatsoever.

It Moved Faster Than Any Satellite I Ever Viewed And My Wife Commented About How It Might Be A Ufo. We Laughed About It Until Another 20 Miles And I Happened To Look Back Toward The Town Of Hanna. This Was A Crystal Clear Night And The Milky Way Was Visible As Well As All The Stars. What I Saw Appeared To Be An Oil Rig With Very Bright Lights. I Pulled Off Of The Interstate And Pulled Out My 10X50 Bushnell Binoculars. I Am A Wildlife Biologist And Always Had My Camera And Binoculars With Me. I Then Noticed That I Could See The Town Of Hanna Right Below The Craft, An Oil Rig Would Partially Cover The Town Lights. It (Hanna) Was 30 Miles N Of Us From I-80. I Gave The Binoculars To My Wife To Witness This Event. She Then Said 'Oh My God Another Craft Has Emerged From Below The Ship.' I Then Told Her To Stay Warm And I Would Go Out To The Road Edge And Get A Picture And Better View. I Viewed The Smaller Craft Drift Slowly To The Ground (Sagebrush Desert And Cattle Grazing Blm Land). The Rotation Of The Police Bubble Light Was Very Slow And Staggered And The Color Was Orange Not Red Like Emergency Vehicles. It Was So Dark That I Could Only Make Out Some Silver Metallic Bottom To The Craft. It Was Drifting At A 45º Angle From The Mother Ship And Toward A Ground Landing. I Did Witness The Smaller Craft Land Behind The Sagebrush Ridge. It Was About 45º With The Wind Chill And 30 Mph Wind, Constant. I Felt That I Was Being Watched By The Mother Craft That Was Hovering So I Left The Sighting. The Mother Ship Had Rectangular White Lights Located Along The Bottom Of The Ship And They Were In Pairs Side By Side, 6 Total From The S Side Of The Craft That I Happened To See From My Ground Angle.\"",

We Were Lucky To See What We Saw And Openly Speak About It. I Only Wish That We Could Go Through A Hypnosis To Repeat The Experience. Perhaps You Can Help Us On This. It Was A Warm Summer Friday Night And I Was Standing On The Upper Deck Of The Swimming Pool, Bushing The Sides With A Long Pole And Brush Attached To It. The Pool Lights Were On. Our Kids, Were Planning To Swim The Next Morning And I Wanted The Pool Clean. My Wife And Kids Were Watching Television Approximately 40 Feet From Where I Stood. It Was Around 9:30 Pm. As I Moved My Hands Upwards To Grab The Upper End Of The Pole Something Caught My Vision. It Was A Craft Approaching At A Low Altitude Perhaps A Block Away. It Had Lights On The Front Portion That Clearly Did Not Look Like A Helicopter. We Were Used To Seeing Sheriff Helicopters Patrolling Over Our Neighborhood, Often Flying Low Or Hovering Over Our Pool Area To Get Glances Of My Wife And Her Friends Laying Out. We Often Waved Them Off Using One Finger. I Kept Looking At The Approaching Craft And Then Realized It Was Not A Helicopter But Something Very Different. I Ran To Our Back Door And Yelled At My Wife And Kids To Come And See What I Was Seeing. {For Complete Comments See Email}",

The Craft Seemed To Appear Spontaneously, First With Glowing Red Pulse Around It. Then, It Hovered And Somehow Reamined Over Our Vehicle Even As We Drove. The Driver Had Not Yet Seen It, And Was Listening To My Description. As It \"Hovered\", I Was Fascinated And Clearly Saw What Looked Like Blackened Portals Around The Side And The Bottom, And I Had The Feeling That We Were Being Observed But Could Not See \"Them\". Suddenly, It Left As Spontaneously As It Had Appeared In The Sky. My Driver Saw It Leaving And Floored The Accelerator, As Well As Did The Camper Ahead Of Us. I Called Mcclellan Afb, But They Would Not Listen To Me. However, I Learned From A Newspaper Article A Few Days Later That Two Fisherman Down In Rio Vista, The The South, Had Also Reported A Similar Sighting.

The Brass Was Called They Came Out With Cameras And All But It Never Reappeared. An Hour After They Left We Saw It Come Back This Time Low And Slow From The Direction Of A Light House (East) And Came Toward The Base Over The Rendelsham Forest. It Was Over Our Heads. And Then I Don'T Really Remember It Leaving Until It Was Over My Right Shoulder A Bit And About Half Way Across The Base. It Then Just Drifted Up Slowly Into The Stars To The Point That I Could Not Tell The Difference Between It And A Star And Soon I Had No Idea Which Star Was The Ship. I Swear This Is True And Happened Just Like That. Oddly Enough No One Very Really Seems To Care That This Happened Right Across The Dirt Road From The Famous Raf Bentwaters Sighting In Later 1980. I Was Friends With Soe Of The Other Security Specialist That Were Involved With That Sighting As Well. I Find The Most Important Fact Is That The Deputy Base Commander'S Wife Came With Him Along With His Son And Had A Camera (Nikon) And The Wife Stated \" Oh Boy I Hope We Get To See One This Time\" Why Would She Say A Thing Like That? I Was 18 At The Time And After That I Got Side Tracked In Life A Bit And Became A Mercenary Full Time For The Next Seven Years Or So And To Be Honest I Was Pretty Brutal In My Combat Actions. I Had No Real Heart Or Love For My Fellow Man. Interesting Enough I Went In The Service Wanting To Be A Nurse And Help Other People. I Did A Complete 180 After That Though.

She'S Never Going To Forget This, There Were A Lot Of People Around. She, Her Husband And Son Were Coming Home About 8:30 P.M. They Came Up Their Driveway And Noticed Some Neighbors Outside. The Neighbors Told Them They Spotted Something In The Sky, So Inez And Her Family Also Looked Up And Saw A Big Red Glowing Light, About As High As Helicopter Altitude. It Was Not Moving, Just Sitting Still. They All Talked About It, And The Neighbors Said It Had Been Moving, But Now Was Stopped. There Was No Noise. They Kept Watching, And It Started Moving. It Came Towards Their Houses, Then Turned And Went Away From The Houses; It Kept Going, And Went About A Half Mile And Stopped Again. Then It Started Coming Back Towards Them Again. There Was A Helicopter Flying Around And She Went Into Call The Pd To See If Anybody Had Reported This Light; They Told Her It Was A Helicopter. She Said No It Wasn'T, Because They Had Seen The Helicopter And This Wasn'T It. In Fact The Helicopter Wasn'T Even Close To Them But They Could Hear It. She Went Back Outside, And It Had Stopped Right Over Them. They Were All Looking At It. It Was Just Sitting There, Then It Started Moving Again, This Time The Other Way. Then It Stopped Again, And Her Son (About Age 11 At The Time) Took Out A Pair Of Binoculars And Looked. She Said He Saw Tiny Blue Lights Underneath It, The Shape Of A Disk. She Did Not Look Through The Binoculars, But When Seen With Her Naked Eye There Was No Shape, It Was Just A Big Red Light. It Had Stopped Again. When It Moved It Was Real Slow. Suddenly, It Startled Them When It Started Blinking Really Fast Like A Strobe Light, Red And White, Really Fast, Then Suddenly It Took Off So Fast It Left A Trail Of White Behind It, Cutting Through The Air. She Watched It Fly Toward Whittier Hills Until She Couldn'T See It Any More. It Never Made One Noise. Her Husband And Son Now Don'T Want To Talk About It, But She Keeps Thinking About It.",

It Was A Cool, Pleasant, Clear Night And I Had My Window Rolled Down. We Were Only Going A Couple Of Blocks. I Lay My Head In The Open Window And Looked Up To Enjoy The Stars. All Of A Sudden, It Was Like A Huge Black Thing Came Straight Down On Us. I Could See It Because It Blacked Out The Stars. I Though We Were Being Squashed And I Ducked Down In The Car And Screamed \"What Is That?\" Cheryl Said \"What? Where?\" When Nothing Happened, I Looked Out Again And It Was Clearly Outlined (By Stars Shining Around The Edges) As A Triangle. It Made No Sound And Appeared To Be Maybe 25-30 Feet Above The Light And Telephone Poles, But Was Not Reflecting Any Light From The Lights. Cheryl Said \"Where Is It? I Don'T See Anything!\" I Said \"Look Where The Stars Aren'T! They'Re Blacked Out!\" One Of My Sons Said \"I See It! I See It!\" Cheryl Was Still Looking First Out The Front Window, Then Out Of Her Side Window. I Kept Watching And All Of A Sudden, The Stars Started Filling In Rapidly, And I Knew It Was Going Straight Up. I Couldn'T See It At All In A Matter Of Seconds. Within 10 Minutes, 4 Fighter Jets Were Over Us. We Stood In Cheryl'S Front Yard And Watched Them. We Are Used To Seeing Fighter Jets Because They Often Come From Moody Afb In Valdosta To Play War Games (They Chase Each Other, Do Maneuvers, Shoot Flares, Etc.), But These Jets Were Doing Something Different. They Would Go From S To N In A Straight Line, Almost Out Of Sight, Then Turn Around And Come Back, But Over Some. They Did This About 5-6 Times, Then Go W To E, Turn, Then Go E To W. This Pattern Formed A Grid. When We Went To Bed At 1:00 Am, They Were Still Flying. (I'Ve Never Known Them To Fly So Long. Usually Their Games Only Last About 45 Minutes. Over Our Area. Cheryl Never Did See It Because She Was Looking Back And Forth Out The Front And Side Windows, And It Left So Fast. My Oldest Son, Tommy Said He Saw Lights At Each Corner.

At The Time There Was A Lot Of Activity At The Test Site, And We Knew There Was Some Secret Jet Or Something Being Built. Lots Of New Jobs, Heightened Security, Etc. So I Figured That What I Had Seen Might Have Been A Trial Run Of Whatever It Was That Was Being Built Out There. I Anticipated Finally Seeing The Stealth, Because I Thought That Was Probabaly What I'D Seen, But What I Saw Didn'T Look Anything Like That, With The Exception Of The Black Color. I Don'T Know What This Was. It Wasn'T A Triangle, Either.

I Thought It Was Strange That No One Else Took Any Notice. I Just Went On My Way, But Something Kept Niggling Away At My Consciousness.. There Just Seemed Something Kind Of \"Unreal\" About Them. A Couple Of Weeks Later, I Figured Out That The Absence Of Sound Was What Seemed Funny To Me. If They Were So Low As To Appear So Big, Why Wouldn'T There Be Some Sort Of Huge Noise?

He Had No Idea What It Was, But He Could See Big Long Poles Sticking Out. The Center Story He Couldn'T See Because Of A Skirt Type Thing; Underneath He Could See People In The Windows. There Was A Small Area 10-20 Feet High; On Top Of That Was A Rounded Skirt; Rectangular In Shape. On Top, The Next Story Was Molded Round But Still Rectangular And That Was All He Could See Because Of The Angle. After About 10 Minutes, It Started Slowly Moving S With No Noise.

It Seemed To Be Working A Grid In The Wilderness And Then Rose Up Directly Behind Camp Over Small Knoll And Bottom Light Lit Up The Forest. It Then Shot Into Space Faster Than Their Eyes Could Follow. The Witness Experienced A Vibration Or Fluttering In His Abdomen When It Was Close, Then Experienced A Cognizant And Euphoric Yet Distant Memory Of The Incident. (The Witnesses Did Not Speak Of It On Their 5-Hour Ride Home The Next Day. They Cut Their Trip Short By Several Days For No Apparent Reason.) He Experienced Bewilderment And Utter Confusion. (He Is Familiar With Aircraft, Military Aircraft In Particular, And This Was Not A Known Craft.)\n\nThen Jet-Powered Aircraft Flew Into The Area At Treetop Level As If Coming To See. It Was Gone And Looked Like A Bright Star Again. As Far As He Knows, It Never Came In Contact With The Round; It Hovered Over Tall Deciduous Hardwood Trees On Top Of A Ridge, Then Silently Propelled Itself Back To Appearing As If It Were In The Stars Again.\n\n\"This Thing Did Not!!!!!

He Estimated It To Have Been Within 1000-2000 Feet Up, Heading In A Sw Direction, Coming From Ne. He Stood There And Watched Until It Passed Out Of Sight. Afterwards, He Stood There For Several Minutes, Not Believing What He Had Just Seen But Realized It Was A Ufo. He Made Note Of Several Things At Once: No Sound, Which Was Rather Strange To Him; When It Passed Out Of Sight, He Heard Dogs Going Crazy Nearby, Howling And Barking. He Walked The Rest Of The Way To Parents’ Home, Got On The Phone Immediately To The Hays County Sheriff’S Department Dispatch And Told Them What He’D Seen. Dispatch Told Him That He Had Also Gotten Some Other Reports From Other People In The Area Of A Ufo. Then Scott Contacted Mufon. Scott And The Mufon Rep (David Spencer, No Relation) Both Then Called The Sheriff'S Department To Get A Transcript Of Scott’S Report And To See If He Could Get Other Reports As Well, Under Foia.

It Was Late, But I Was In Good Spirits And Quite Awake With, A Warm Cup Of Coffee To My Side, And Chewing On Some Ginseng Chips I'D Bought In San Francisco Last Time. The Object Took Me By Surprise, And Was Impossible To Miss. I Coming Down A Hill, And Had A Generous View Of The Surrounding Valley. The Object Shot Directly Across My Field Of View, From My Windshield. It Traced A Line To My Left, High In The Sky About 45º Off The Horizon. It Trailed Off At A Point Above The Horizon To My Front. My First Thought Was Sheer Awe - It Was So Beautiful. I Had Listened To Inspiring Speakers, Such As Stephen Greer Before, And Of Course Met Mike Miller Just Weeks Earlier. Although What They Testified To Was Incredible, I Recognized Them As Sincere People. The Event In The Sky, Felt Like A Reward For My Faith, And I Was Extremely Grateful. Then On Second Thought, It Occurred To Me, It Might Have Simply Been The Most Amazing Flying Star Ever. So I Made A Wish. The Sighting Hasn'T Affected Or Changed The Course Of My Life. It Was More Like Icing On The Cake. It Did Serve As Extra Incentive To Come To Oregon And Get Unitel Funded. Mike Miller'S Knowledge Of Quantum Physics Should Be Enabled, To Actually Bring Humanity On Par, With Other Spacefaring Civilizations. This Was A Very Dramatic Event, Not Just A Light In The Sky. The Object Was Very Bright And Very Fast.\"\n\nThis Event Occurred 3 Weeks After The Witness Met The Founders Of Unitel, A Group Possessing Knowledge For How To Implement Technology They Witnessed From A Ufo That Landed Near Them In 1981.

Is Life Really The Way We Perceive It To Be?\" We Have Money And Food, Etc., But How Necessary Are These Things?

When It Was Really Close She Could Hear A \"Magnetic Generated Sound\", No Sound She’D Ever Heard Before, \"A Renaissance Of Low Pulsating Tones, Elongated Out.\" She Freaked Out, Called To Her Friend To Get Back In The Car, Afraid Something Bad Would Happen, But Her Friend Refused, Saying \"They’Re My Friends, I'Ve Been Talking To Them, They’Ve Done Experiments, They’Re My Friends.\" Bonnie Said The Sky Was \"Very Active\" At That Moment, As Others Started Dropping In But Not As Close As This One. Bonnie Was Scared. From Every Single Angle Of The Sky, Over 100 Were Dropping Down (She Stopped Counting At 60), And She Was Overwhelmed. Her Friend Wouldn’T Get In The Car, Saying \"Don’T Worry About It.\" The Friend Has Been Seeing And Communicating With These Lights For 15 Years, \"They Come To Her When She Flashes.\" This Friend Is Also Having Brain Surgery In 2 Weeks, Because She Thinks She Has An Implant: She Bleeds From The Ear, \"Between Skull And Medulla Oblongata.\" [Sketch In File]",

My First Thoughts As Soon As I Realized That This Was Not An Ordinary Occurrence Was: What Could This Be? I Decided That It Was Not A High Flying Military Jet Because The Color And Shape Did Not Look Like One, And It Did Not Have A Vapor Trail. I Thought It Might Have Been The Passing Of A Satellite That The Sun Was Shining On Just Right To Make It Visible In The Daytime. However It Seemed To Be Moving Somewhat Faster That Any Satellite I'Ve Ever Seen In The Night Sky. Since I Couldn'T Think Of Anything Reasonable That It Could Be, And The Fact That It Just Disappeared As I Was Watching It, I Decided That I Have Seen My First U.F.O.

I Work For The Port Of Everett And At The Time Was Working At The Terminal (Pier1-3) That Is Just An Energetic Swim From The Everett Naval Base. Boeing Is Also In The Area And Test Planes Are Common. It Was Near Dusk, When Headlights Are Necessary To Be Seen, But Not To See With. I Turned South Into The Terminal Area When Something Overhead Caught My Eye. I Saw This Very Black, Triangular Shaped Craft Moving Very Slowly In A Northerly Direction. It Was Very Obvious Against The Nearly Clear Sky. There Were Lights On The Wings And Front Nose Area That Made Me Think That Whatever This Was, It Was Domestic. The Lights Looked Like Faa Regulation Lights. The Fact That Something Was In The Sky Was A Real Shock. This Was During The Time When The Navy Nearly Took A Shot At Our Local Med-Evac Helicopter. Hardly Anything Was Flying Because Of Air Restrictions At The Time. And Certainly, Not This Close To The Navy Base. I Couldn'T Hear It Either. I Shut The Truck Engine Off And Rolled Down The Window. I Could Hear Nearby Kids Playing, Crickets Starting Up And A Couple Of Birds But Not Any Aircraft Engine Noise. The Craft Started To Slow Down Then Came To A Complete And Silent Stop Directly Overhead. My First Notion Was \"Uh Oh. They Know I'M Watching.\" After A Few Moments, The Craft Turned In Place To A North-Westerly Direction And Flew Off, Again, Making No Sound And With A Slow Gain In Speed. It Flew Over The South Edge Of Everett Naval Base And If My Dead-Reckoning Guess Is Right, It Appeared To Be Heading Directly To The Whidbey Air Force Base On Whidbey Island. The Coast Guard Had Troops In Place On Nearby Bluffs And Ncis Had Agents All Over The Place At The Time. { See File For The Complete Narrative}",

If Forward Could Be Called 12 O'Clock, The Corners Of The Triangle Were At Approximately 2 O'Clock (White Light), 5 O'Clock (Red Light), And 9 O'Clock (White Light). This Vehicle Maintained A Constant Speed And Direction, And I Last Observed It Westbound, Just South Of The Bethany College Campus, Over Central Lindsborg, Kansas. I Have Told Only A Handful Of People Of This Sighting, And Made A Crude Sketch Of It Which I Had To Search For. I Did Not Think *Too* Much Of This Incident At The Time, Believing It Probably A Usaf Project Out Of Mcconnell Afb, Roughly, 100 Miles South Of The College. I Was In Lindsborg Through May Of 1998, And Have Spent Considerable Time In Wichita, Ks (Home Of Mcconnell Afb) Since, And Have Never Observed Another Object Even Remotely Similar To This One.",

It Was A Beautiful Night With A Cool Wind Blowing And Some Scattered Puffy Clouds. I Looked To The N And Saw An Object Coming Toward Me That I Estimated To Be 500-1000 Feet In Altitude. My First Impression Was A Flock Of White Canadian Geese, But As It Got Directly Overhead I Could See The Body Of The Craft. I First Thought It Was Boomerang In Shape Because Of The Formation Of Dim White Lights On The Leading Edge Perimeter. It Was Moving Silently Overhead Toward The S. It Flew Over The Lighted Fairground And Baseball Diamond Area That Is Across The Highway From My Home In Which Some Activity Was Going On. As It Got Over The Lights I Could See The Body Of The Craft More Vividly. It Was A Dull Gray Or Aluminum Color With Ridges Near The Rear Of The Craft That Were Running Parallel With The Craft. The Trailing Edge Of The Craft Was Straight Across. The Craft Accelerated As It Got Past The Lights Of The Fairground And Disappeared Quickly. I Went Back Into The House Astonished. One Hour Later At Approximately 1110 P.M. I Decided To Go Back Out And Look Again. This Time I Took My Digital Camera Which I Use As A Web Camera On My Computer And Also As A Regular Camera. I Turned It On Before I Went Outside. I Walked To The Same Spot I Was Standing Before, In My Front Lawn, And Looked To The N Again. There Came Either The Same Craft Or Another Identical Craft As The First. This Craft Seemed To Be A Few Feet Lower And Was Going In Slightly A Sw Direction. I Raised My Camera And Clicked A Picture And My Camera Went Wild. The Craft Made A Slightly Climbing R Turn And Accelerated Out Of Sight. I Had Other Pictures In The Camera Memory That I Had Not Downloaded In The Computer Yet. When I Downloaded The Pictures All I Had Was 1 Blacked-Out Frame. I Called Mufon To Report The Incident.

Longest Period Actually Looking Right At It, Maximum 15 Minutes, He Was First One There, It Was Hot That Day, He Had Time To Watch It Until Others Got There. Other People Had Seen It In The Valley And Radio Station Mentioned It. The Guy With The Matthews Show Saw The Lights, Not Mel. Nobody Talked About What It Might Have Been. His Crew Chief Had Been In The Service, He Knows Strange Things When He Sees Them, He Said It Was Ufo. He Saw Something Similar To This In Pictures. It Looks Like A Disk-Shape, Cylindrical, Round, Like A Discus Held At An Angle.\n\nFrom Personal On-Scene Follow-Up: \"Garcia Seemed Credible. Stated That He Had Been Alone On The Site At Boyd Stadium In Henderson Setting Up For The Dave Matthews Concert When He Saw The Object. He Drew The Object. It Appeared Cigar Shaped And Large. It Was Shiny Silver And Reflected The Sun. It Had No Features Or Appendages That He Could See. It Was Silent. In Fact Garcia Remarked On The \"Eerie Silence\" As He Looked At It. He Thought It Was About A Mile Away And From Estimating Comparisons Of Incoming Aircraft, The Object Was Probably At About 3000-5000 Ft Altitude. He Gazed At It For About Ten Minutes Or Maybe Even 15 Before Moving On To His Work. He Was Raised On Several Air Force Bases (Nellis, Lachlan Texas And Military Springs, Ogden Utah) So He Knows Aircraft. Interestingly, When We Stood Talking Looking In The Direction Where The Object Had Hovered, Multiple Aircraft Approached For Landing At Mccarran From The Lake Mead Direction, So The Object May Have Been In Or Near The Flight Path. Garcia Is Also Familiar With Goodyear And Mitsubishi Blimps And Is Certain That It Was Not A Blimp.\"",

At First, We Were Joking Around With Each Other. None Of Us Had (To My Knowledge) Ever Seen A Ufo Before, None Of Us Were Prone To Believe In Them. But During The Ten Or So Minutes It Took Me To Drive From Our Starting Point Back Into The City Limits, These Lights (What We Assumed Comprised Some Sort Of Craft) Seemed To Remain Directly, Exactly Overhead. {See Email For Complete Comments}",

The Terrain Was Relatively Flat. The Sun Was Just Above The Horizon On My Left (About 10º), Its Light Softened By A Light Haze. Exactly Opposite On My Right I Saw What I Believed At First To Be A Boeing 727 Landing On A Airfield On The Northern End Of Fort Drum. It Struck Me As Little Odd -- A Commercial Aircraft Landing On A Military Base -- But Not Implausible. (I Know That Such Planes Can Be Converted For Cargo Use.) After About 15 Seconds Of Watching It, I Realized That I Was Moving, But It Was Not. As I Had Assumed It Was Landing, I Continued To Watch (Holding My Breath) Waiting For It To Do What I Expected. It Did Nothing. Fiinally After About A Minute, My View Was Obsured By Trees, And That Was The Last I Saw Of It. In Terms Of Distance From Me, I Estimate That If I Had Stopped The Car And Walked Overland To The \"Airfield,\" It Would Have Taken 20-40 Minutes. Therefore I Am Guessing It Was About 1-2 Miles Away. Other Information: I Have 25 Years Working For Or Around Military, And For Several Years Managed The Funding Of Advanced Civilian Degrees For Army Officers. My Interest In Ufos Is Moderate, And My Belief In Extraterrestrials Falls In The Range Of Skeptical.

When I Saw The Objects, I Rushed Inside To Get My Binoculars Only To Find That My Sister Had Broken Them From When She Had Last Borrowed Them; This Is Why The Event Is So Prominent In My Memory. I Then Got My Telescope, A Small Thing, Maybe 50X, And Dragged It Outside. By The Time I Got Back Outside, The Lead Object Was Over The House Across From Our Driveway, To The N And Had Started Its Turn To The N. I Would Still Swear That There Were 3 Of The Things, But My Notes From The Time Only Indicate A Single Craft. I Believe I Saw 3 Of Them. I Trained My Telescope On The Lead Object And Managed To Get A Lengthy View Until It Was Just Too Much Of A Hassle Keeping It In Focus And Trained, So I Just Used The Mark-1 Eyeball Until They Went Out Of Sight To The N. I Had 8 Minutes Of Clear View, Except For My Trip Inside For My Binoculars And Telescope, Before They Disappeared Into Some Clouds. There Was Only 1 Star Out At The Time, And The Moon Wasn’T Up Until 9:30Pm. The Only Other Traffic I Saw Was An Airplane On The Opposite Sky When The Objects Were Almost Out Of View. I Know Aircraft, And Was A Member Of The Air Force Jrotc At My High School. I Can’T Think Of Any Aircraft That Would Take 8 Minutes To Travel A Mile. To Describe Them, Think Of A Dorito Chip With Very Rounded Corners. Now, Take The Chip And Bend The Rounded Corners Up To Form A Shallow Bowl Shape. Put A Small Raised Hump On Top Of The Chip In The Center (Only Just Visible Past The Edge) And A Small Circular Light On The Bottom In Each Corner And That’S Pretty Much It. The Object Was An Overall Grey, And The Lights Were Pretty Much Just White Spots, Not Bright, In Fact, Not Visible Until I Used The Telescope.

They Were Sitting Outside On Their Deck Talking Both Times. As They Talked They Scanned The Sky For Satellites, Shooting Stars, And Planes. On Both Occasions Her Eyes Caught An Object Growing Brighter. It'S Hard To Remember How She Spotted It Because Both Times It Seemed To Grow From A Small Size And Wasn'T Seen To Be Moving Until After It Faded. The First Time, She Described It To Her Husband And Was Astounded When He Saw It 2 Weeks Later. They'D Been Talking About \"Deep\" Subjects Just Prior, And In Their Minds Connected It To That It Felt It Was A \"Sign.\" They Also Tried To Think Of More Rational Explanations But Couldn'T Come Up With Anything. It Seemed Stationary When They First Saw It. It Grew From Star Sized To A Large, Incredibly Bright Emanation, Then Back Down To Its Original Size Before Seeming To Move Out Of The Atmosphere And Become Smaller Until It Disappeared In Both A Short Amount Of Time And Space. The Second Sighting 2 Weeks Later (06/23/00) Was Exactly The Same, In The Identical Part Of The Sky That It Was The First Time. Again, When They First Spotted It, It Seemed To Be At A Standstill, Grew In Brightness, Returned To \"Normal\", And Then Moved Off, Disappearing At Seemingly The Same Point In The Sky.\nThe First Time, She Thought It Must Be A Plane Turning So That Its Lights Became Bright As It Faced Her Direction. But It Grew Brighter Without Moving In Any Direction. It Was Seemingly Stationary, Growing Brighter And Larger, Then It Shrunk Down To Its Original Size And Began Moving. There Had Been Several Small Planes Earlier That Evening And Large Jets At Cruising Altitude Which Could Be Heard. This Was Silent. Husband'S Comment: I Feel I Viewed An Event Rather Than Just An Object Per Se. A Stationary Point Of Light That Appeared To Grow To About 20 Times Its Initial Size - An Extremely Bright White Light, Almost Like A Small Sun - Which Then Appeared To Reduce Back To Its Initial Dimensions, Then Began To Move To The Right And At The Same Time Appearing To Diminish In Size As Though It Were Going Into Deep Space.

(Attended Arizona Diamondbacks Baseball Game The Evening Of July 23, 2001) We Proceeded South On 7Th St. To The Interstate (I-17). We Made A Left Turn Onto The Interstate Going West. After About 300 Feet West Of Our Entry Onto I-17, My 13 Year Old Grandson Called Our Attention To The Right Side Of The Car (North). When We Looked To Our Right We Saw A Large Craft Hovering Over The Arizona Museum Of Science And Technology Not More Than 1 Mile Away (This Is Where The Baseball Park Is Located). The Craft Was No More Than 50 Feet Above These Buildings. The Ship Was At Least 300 Feet Long. The Craft Had A Yellow Glow To It (Soft Light). We Observed One White Light On Top Of This Cigar Shaped Craft, One Red Light On Either End And One Red Light On The Bottom Of The Craft. We Stopped To Observe This Ship And Took 2 Pictures Of The Craft. We Observed The Ship For Approximately 10 Minutes Before It Began To Move Slowly To The West At No Greater Than 10 Miles Per Hour. At This Time I Started The Car To Pursue This Object. We Turned Off On 7Th Ave. Going North (Distance Between 7Th St. And 7Th Ave Is Less Than One Mile). I Proceeded On 7Th Ave. For About 10 Mile (About 1 Hour Chase Time). I Was Attempting To Get Underneath This Ship. After 1 Hour We Managed To Get Within About One Half Mile Of The Craft. At This Time We Were In A Dark, Quiet Neighborhood. My Grandson And Myself Got Out Of Our Car At This Point In Order To See The Ship More Clearly And To See If We Could Hear Any Engine Sounds (There Was No Sound). The Ship Then Turned To The East And Disappeared. I Have Seen A Number Of These Craft While In Prescott (Retired Here 9 Years Ago).",

Over 5 Minutes It Slowly Moved Toward Us, Making No Sound And Not More Than 500 Feet Above Us. When It Reached Our Position It Stopped Mid-Air. It Was Circular, But Elongated A Bit.

I Was Trying To Keep And Eye On It When It Went Into The Field It Was Hard To See Because It Was Very Dark Out There Because It Is All Farmlands And It Was So Low It Could Have Touched The Ground Or Landed.

That Freaked Us Out Thinking It Was Going To Hit Us And My Cousin Sped Up And Then It Moved Up And Around Then Went Into The Field Again And It Went Low And Then We Did Not See Where It Went. Then We Were Driving For A Few Miles Up The Road Without Seeing It And Then It Was Again, My Cousin Saw It In The Rear View Mirror The Bright Headlights Coming Up Behind Us Just A Few Feet Above The Car, But This Time Just On The Right Side Of The Interstate And Then It Turned Right Into The Fields And We Did Not See It Again.

As We Approached His Street, We Noticed 3 Bright Amber Lights Flying In A Triangular Formation In The Sky Also Approaching The Area From The South West, Heading North East. We Assumed They Were Helicopters Surveying The Area Because They Were Flying So Low, But As They Were So Close But Making No Noise We Were Perplexed. I Turned My Car'S Engine Off In Front Of Peter'S House And Got Out. The Night Sky Was Clear And Windless And Very Cold (About 5C). We All Watched The Lights Objects Move Above Us And Wondered Why There Was No Noise From Such Aircraft. Peter Quickly Ran Into His House And Brought Out Some Binocular, But All We Could Observe Of Each Of The Objects Was An Intense Amber Light. No Navigation Lights. Two Of The Objects Went Off To The North, Then One Stopped. The Other One Of These Two Went A Little Further Stopped, Then Went Back At The Now Startionary Object As If To Collide, Then Narrowly Missed It. Both They Then Proceeded To Head Eastward At An Increasing Speed And Altitude. The Third Object Joined Then And They Reformed The Triangular Formation As They All Headed Off Due East At Great Speed And Increading Altitude.
