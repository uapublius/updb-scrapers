No Met or othe balloons could be traced which having been released could have reached this area/time nor which could have appeared black. They were at a loss to identify the reported object since its shape and behavior did not seem to fit any recognizable piece of aviation equipment white the temperature inversion made it unlikely that something like a piece of black polyethene could have been carried to that level.
