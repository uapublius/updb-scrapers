Each time the light moved a little farther everything went normal again.","EME: Suddenly, the pilot's watch stopped. The control jammed.

Control was fortunately regained when almost touching the tree tops and the plane was landed in one piece - with a badly shaken pilot. During the encounter the directional electric gyroscope (connected to a magnetic compass) rotated wildly, and by the time the plane landed it had deviated by 180\u00b0 relative to the magnetic compass.","EME: unexpectedly, the airplane began to turn left. He then noticed that the 3 cockpit compasses were all giving different readings. At this point, the co-pilot turned off the autopilot and took manual control of the airplane.

When the F-4 turned away from the object and apparently was no longer a threat to it, the aircraft regained all instrumentation and communications. The pilot attempted to fire an AIM-9 missle at the object but at that instant his weapons control panel went off and he lost all communications (UHF and interphone). The F-4 crew had regained communications and the weapons control panel. There was a lot of interference on the UHF and each time they passed through a mag. bearing of 150 degrees from Mehrabad they lost their communications (UHF and interphone) and the INS fluctuated from 30 degrees to 50 degrees during 360\u00b0 orbit by F-4 pilot's dark adaptation was regained (est. duration of INS fluctuation was 10-15 sec, while at radial of 150\u00b0 from Mehrabad).","EME: Suddenly the Piper went into two rapid 360\u00b0 clockwise rolls from which the pilot had to recover from manually. He discovered that his magnetic compass was spinning in a clockwise direction so fast that he couldn't read the number in its square window. The compass eventually returned to normal operation after the UAP departed.","EME: the plane is not under my control. He could not control his altitude or turn the plane. The landing gear did not work. The plane began to climb escorted by the three objects. The radio stopped to function several minutes.
