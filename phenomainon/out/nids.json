Sharon Looked \u0026 Looked \u0026 Still Could Not See It. So She Prayed For Her \"Spiritual Eyes\" To Be Opened Since She Believed Her Acutely Visual-Oriented, Artistic Son Was Truly Seeing What He Was Describing.

She Described It To Jeremy As Being A Black Or Very Dark Gray Triangle That Was Flying From Above The Moon \u0026 Down Diagonally Toward The Right Side Of The Moon. She Stated It Had A Lighter Gray \"Tail\" Behind It And That It All Looked \"Smudged\" As If Being Tried To Have Been Erased By A Pencil. Jeremy Confirmed All Of These Details. Once The Smudged Triangle Got To The Right Side (Mid-Section) Of The Moon It \"Blinked Out.\" Both Sharon And Jeremy Confirmed This With Each Other. It Was Not Seen Again.

Available At The Time Of The Sighting. An Estimate Could Have Been Made If The Object Occulted Or Was Occulted By Such A Visual Reference, But That Was Not The Case. My Estimation Will Have To Come By Its Perceived Speed Alone.\nUsing That As A Reference, And Using Known Aircraft Types \u0026 Speeds (In A Very General Sense) I'D Say Our Visitor Had A \"Wingspan\" Similar To That Of A Commercial Jetliner (757/767), Had An Altitude Of 1,500 To 3,000 Feet, And Traveled At Approximately 100Mph.","They Looked Fairly Low (Below 1,000'), And The Beam From My Handheld Laser Was Visible As A Green Spot On One Of The Objects. That Should Leave The One I Hit At Well Below 3,000', As That Is The Approximate Maximum Range Of That Laser I Used In The Atmospheric \u0026 Lighting Conditions Present At The Time. \nThe First Object Glided Silently, Nearly Overhead But Somewhat To The Nnw, And Slowly Vanished As It Headed Out Over The Water And Away From The Sodium Vapor Lamps In The Streets Below). It Was Large Enough To Clearly See A Shape, And It Appeared Mostly Circular Or Disk Shaped. The Second, Smaller One Appeared To Be Circular Or Possible Spheroid; And Acted Much Like The First Until I Shot At *And Hit It* It With A Low-Powered Handheld Laser With A 532Nm Wavelength And A Measured Output Power Of 7.6 Milliwatts Typical, 11.62 Milliwatts Maximum. I Could Briefly See The Green Spot On The Underside Of The Object Several Times As The Handheld Laser Was Aimed Towards It. The Beam Itself Could Be Seen As A Line In The Sky, So Targeting Wasn'T An Issue; Locking Onto A Moving Target Was. So The Spot Would Appear As A Brief Green Flash On The Underside Of The Object As It Passed Overhead And As My Laser Beam Scanned Across It. After I Hit It Several Times, It Slowed Down, Made An Abrupt Turn To The N Or Slightly Nnw, Kept Moving Slowly For A Few More Seconds, And Then Stopped Dead In The Air. By This Time I Rid Myself Of The Laser Because I Honestly Thought The Object Was Going To Start Shooting Back. It Then Just Hung Stationary For 15-20 Seconds, And Then Suddenly Vanished, Like Somebody Turning Off A Lamp. Note That I Would Never Shoot A Laser Or Other Light Source At Aircraft Showing Nav Lights Of Any Type, With Any Type Of Engine Sounds, Or Showing Wings Or Other Body Parts Consistent With Known Aircraft Design. I Shot At These Objects Thinking They Were Possibly Balloons Or Plastic Bags Caught Up In The Breeze. Only Afterwards I Realised The Dominant Wind Direction (Light, From The N To Nne) Was Inconsistent With The Flight Path Taken By These Objects.\n\nI Also Looked *Very Thoroughly* For Any Moving Parts To Try And Rule Out A Sea Bird As The Offending Object, And Did Not See Any Movement Or Lighting Change Of Any Type Consistent With The Flapping Of Bird Wings; Nor Did I Notice Any Lateral Elongation, Nonlinear Flight, Or Wobbling That Might Indicate A Bird Gliding On Air Currents.\n\nThe Flight Path \u0026 Behavior, Especially Of The Second Object, Was Not Consistent With The Wind Speed \u0026 Direction At The Time Of Sighting (As Determined By Puffs Of Smoke Or Fog That Would Occasionally Drift By Overhead). I'M Therefore *Reasonably* Certain I Did Not See Balloons, Sheets Of Paper, Or Plastic Bags.","Norman And His Wife Saw This While Walking. They Noticed A Large Light In Each Corner.

(Only Later, Upon Careful Analysis Of What I Experienced, I Recalled There May Have Been A 'Nice' Tall Big-Eyed Long-Limbed Special Insect-Type There; I Recall Having Good 'Vibes' From This One: Friendly, Love, Caring Type, Not Religious, Just Like A Good Family Doctor You Know And Trust.)

I Considered One Of The Doctors Was The Husband Of Someone I Knew At Work. I Was Just Out Of High School, 18 Or 19, And Worked At A Place Called Schweber Electronics. There Was A Young Lady Working There Who Had Told Me At One Time That Her Husband Was A Brain Surgeon! I Don'T Know If She Told Me Before Or After, But During Those Months, I Was Kinda Freaked About Her Being An Alien! Of Course I Considered All This Impossible - So Just Tried To Forget It.

He Feels They'Re Terrestrial In Origin. He Has An Extensive Background, As A Layperson, In The Study Of Physics, Particle And String Theory, And Theory In Quantum Mechanics. He Is Thoroughly Convinced That People Cannot Travel At Or Near The Speed Of Light. He Does Not Believe In Time Travel For The Same Reasons. \"We'Re Fragile And Complicated Beings.

About June 1980 At About 1 Am. I Was A Passenger In A Vehicle Driving A Back Road Behind Rancho Seco Nuclear Power Plant. It Was Clear And Dark Outside. The Craft Seemed To Appear Spontaneously, First With Glowing Red Pulse Around It. Then, It Hovered And Somehow Reamined Over Our Vehicle Even As We Drove. The Driver Had Not Yet Seen It, And Was Listening To My Description. As It \"Hovered\", I Was Fascinated And Clearly Saw What Looked Like Blackened Portals Around The Side And The Bottom, And I Had The Feeling That We Were Being Observed But Could Not See \"Them\". Suddenly, It Left As Spontaneously As It Had Appeared In The Sky. My Driver Saw It Leaving And Floored The Accelerator, As Well As Did The Camper Ahead Of Us. I Called Mcclellan Afb, But They Would Not Listen To Me. However, I Learned From A Newspaper Article A Few Days Later That Two Fisherman Down In Rio Vista, The The South, Had Also Reported A Similar Sighting. I Do Not Feel Any \"Time Loss\" Went On, But My Focus Of Consciousness Shortly Thereafter Had Me Studying Metaphysical Sciences Fervently And Discovering Somewhat That I Already \"Knew\" These Principles.","1 metallic gray saucer with a red light on top with arched windows.

An Hour After They Left We Saw It Come Back This Time Low And Slow From The Direction Of A Light House (East) And Came Toward The Base Over The Rendelsham Forest. It Was Over Our Heads. And Then I Don'T Really Remember It Leaving Until It Was Over My Right Shoulder A Bit And About Half Way Across The Base. It Then Just Drifted Up Slowly Into The Stars To The Point That I Could Not Tell The Difference Between It And A Star And Soon I Had No Idea Which Star Was The Ship. I Swear This Is True And Happened Just Like That. Oddly Enough No One Very Really Seems To Care That This Happened Right Across The Dirt Road From The Famous Raf Bentwaters Sighting In Later 1980. I Was Friends With Soe Of The Other Security Specialist That Were Involved With That Sighting As Well. I Find The Most Important Fact Is That The Deputy Base Commander'S Wife Came With Him Along With His Son And Had A Camera (Nikon) And The Wife Stated \" Oh Boy I Hope We Get To See One This Time\" Why Would She Say A Thing Like That? I Was 18 At The Time And After That I Got Side Tracked In Life A Bit And Became A Mercenary Full Time For The Next Seven Years Or So And To Be Honest I Was Pretty Brutal In My Combat Actions.

I Work For The Port Of Everett And At The Time Was Working At The Terminal (Pier1-3) That Is Just An Energetic Swim From The Everett Naval Base. Boeing Is Also In The Area And Test Planes Are Common. It Was Near Dusk, When Headlights Are Necessary To Be Seen, But Not To See With. I Turned South Into The Terminal Area When Something Overhead Caught My Eye. I Saw This Very Black, Triangular Shaped Craft Moving Very Slowly In A Northerly Direction. It Was Very Obvious Against The Nearly Clear Sky. There Were Lights On The Wings And Front Nose Area That Made Me Think That Whatever This Was, It Was Domestic. The Lights Looked Like Faa Regulation Lights. The Fact That Something Was In The Sky Was A Real Shock. This Was During The Time When The Navy Nearly Took A Shot At Our Local Med-Evac Helicopter. Hardly Anything Was Flying Because Of Air Restrictions At The Time. And Certainly, Not This Close To The Navy Base. I Couldn'T Hear It Either. I Shut The Truck Engine Off And Rolled Down The Window. I Could Hear Nearby Kids Playing, Crickets Starting Up And A Couple Of Birds But Not Any Aircraft Engine Noise. The Craft Started To Slow Down Then Came To A Complete And Silent Stop Directly Overhead. My First Notion Was \"Uh Oh. They Know I'M Watching.\" After A Few Moments, The Craft Turned In Place To A North-Westerly Direction And Flew Off, Again, Making No Sound And With A Slow Gain In Speed. It Flew Over The South Edge Of Everett Naval Base And If My Dead-Reckoning Guess Is Right, It Appeared To Be Heading Directly To The Whidbey Air Force Base On Whidbey Island. The Coast Guard Had Troops In Place On Nearby Bluffs And Ncis Had Agents All Over The Place At The Time. { See File For The Complete Narrative}","There Is A Lot Of Information Missing From This Report.

Suddenly It Shot Off Into The Sky, Over The Horizon, Directly Away From Them. (Somebody Suggested Recently That Perhaps He Had Witnessed This Craft Shifting Dimensions.) It Didn'T Go L/R Or Any Other Direction. At School The Next Day, 1/3 Of Kids On The Playground Had Seen This The Night Before. When He Came Home From School, His Mom Was Sitting At The Table With The Local (Boca Raton) Newspaper And Asked If This Was What They Had Seen - There Had Been An Article But No Photos, About How Local Police And The Fire Department Had Received 100S Of Calls, That The Phone Lines Had Been Tied Up.

Driving Home After Dark From A Latin Club Practice At A Fellow Club Member'S Parents' House, I, My Brother Jerod, And My Best Friend Jason Noticed A Triplet Of Lights That Appeared To Be Directly Overhead. We Didn'T Think Anything Of It, At First --- Not Unusually That Far Out Towards The City'S Edge, But Often Further Towards The Airport, Jumbo Jets Would Pass Directly Over Our Heads Our Heads, Across The Highways, About To Land At San Antonio Int'L. But This Was Different -- The Location Of The Sighting, The Behavior Of The Craft, The Pattern Of The Lights And The Lack Of Any Sound Whatsoever All Caused Us To Start Commenting To Each Other About The Unusual Nature Of The Event. At First, We Were Joking Around With Each Other. None Of Us Had (To My Knowledge) Ever Seen A Ufo Before, None Of Us Were Prone To Believe In Them. But During The Ten Or So Minutes It Took Me To Drive From Our Starting Point Back Into The City Limits, These Lights (What We Assumed Comprised Some Sort Of Craft) Seemed To Remain Directly, Exactly Overhead. {See Email For Complete Comments}","1 Dark grey, dull, rounded, pinched like boomerang object with lights.

The Speed Was Far Too Great. I Don'T Believe The Aircraft Was From Another Solar System Light Years Away. Because, The Ship Propulsion System Couldn'T Be Fast Enough To Travel That Far. The Aircraft Is Just Too Small To Harness That Much Power And Sustain Life In The Void Of Space. However, The Ship Could Be An Alien Probe With No Life Forms On It. But I Hightly Doubt That Theory.

From The Witness'S Original Email Report:\nThis Witness Has Seen This Object Twice (2Nd Time, 06/23/00, Exactly The Same). Her Husband Saw It The Second Time. They Were Sitting Outside On Their Deck Talking Both Times. As They Talked They Scanned The Sky For Satellites, Shooting Stars, And Planes. On Both Occasions Her Eyes Caught An Object Growing Brighter. It'S Hard To Remember How She Spotted It Because Both Times It Seemed To Grow From A Small Size And Wasn'T Seen To Be Moving Until After It Faded. The First Time, She Described It To Her Husband And Was Astounded When He Saw It 2 Weeks Later. They'D Been Talking About \"Deep\" Subjects Just Prior, And In Their Minds Connected It To That It Felt It Was A \"Sign.\" They Also Tried To Think Of More Rational Explanations But Couldn'T Come Up With Anything. It Seemed Stationary When They First Saw It. It Grew From Star Sized To A Large, Incredibly Bright Emanation, Then Back Down To Its Original Size Before Seeming To Move Out Of The Atmosphere And Become Smaller Until It Disappeared In Both A Short Amount Of Time And Space. The Second Sighting 2 Weeks Later (06/23/00) Was Exactly The Same, In The Identical Part Of The Sky That It Was The First Time. Again, When They First Spotted It, It Seemed To Be At A Standstill, Grew In Brightness, Returned To \"Normal\", And Then Moved Off, Disappearing At Seemingly The Same Point In The Sky.\nThe First Time, She Thought It Must Be A Plane Turning So That Its Lights Became Bright As It Faced Her Direction.

There Had Been Several Small Planes Earlier That Evening And Large Jets At Cruising Altitude Which Could Be Heard. This Was Silent.

A Stationary Point Of Light That Appeared To Grow To About 20 Times Its Initial Size - An Extremely Bright White Light, Almost Like A Small Sun - Which Then Appeared To Reduce Back To Its Initial Dimensions, Then Began To Move To The Right And At The Same Time Appearing To Diminish In Size As Though It Were Going Into Deep Space.

Therefore, I Am Willing To Submit To Hypnosis, And Even A Lie Detector To Confirm The Experience. Also, I Would Like To State That After The Sighting I Was Awakened At Night At 3Am To A Ball Of Red/Blue Light Receding Out The Window. I Found A Small Triangle Burned On My Left Wrist (It Burned Like A Cigeratee Burn For About 3 Months). The Mark Remains And Periodically Grows To About An Inch As A Red Mark Every Once In A While. Another Triangle Appeared On My Chest About Two Weeks Later. I Should Also Mention That I Was Wearing Shorts And A T-Shirt That Night Of The Sighting---I Had A Sensation Of A Sunburn On My Legs, Arms, And Face For About A Week. I Want To Emphasize That As An Artist I Have Very Acute Sense Of Observation And That This Is Perhaps The First Opportunity To Study An Image Of A Ufo In Great Detail","Initially, It Was Like A Bright Start; But As We Continued To Watch It And The Sun Sank Lower Below The Horizon, It Wasn'T So Bright But It Was Now Distinguishable As A White Line North Of Our Position On Westbound I-15, Passing Through Barstow.","See Report Dated Oct. 26, 1999","1 silver elongated circular.

The Fireworks Started Late, 9 Or 10 Pm And We Were Lying On Our Bellies In The Tent With Our Heads Sticking Out Watching The Fireworks When My Friend Noticed A Light Hovering Not Far From The Fireworks. It Looked Like A Helicopter Hovering There Just Watching. We Thought It Was A News Copter Getting Footage Of The Night'S Fireworks For The Late Night News. Over 5 Minutes It Slowly Moved Toward Us, Making No Sound And Not More Than 500 Feet Above Us. When It Reached Our Position It Stopped Mid-Air. It Was Circular, But Elongated A Bit. Gray, Flat On The Bottom, Rounded On The Top, With Multi-Colored Lights Which Circled The Bottom And A Window That Wrapped Around The Front Which Showed Light From Inside. After 30 Seconds Of Hovering We Saw A Figure Move From Inside To The Window, Glancing Down To Our Position. It Was Only A Shadow Though And We Couldn'T Make Out Anymore. Both Of Us Just Lay There Staring At It When It Suddenly Shot Straight Up To The Clouds And Then Moved Off At A Great Speed Away From The Fireworks. We Both Ran Inside To Tell My Friend'S Parents We Had Just Seen A Ufo, But They Didn'T Believe Us. I Was Just A Kid, And At That Time We Just Though It Was \"Cool.\" We Didn'T Know It Was Something Out Of The Ordinary.
